# ATYP

Atyp is a text editor written in Deno using TypeScript. It is written basically entirely from scratch
(I don't know how to listen to keyboard inputs, and a library for moving the cursor).

## Getting started

In order to get started, run the application, and type `:help` to open the help menu. There, you can learn more
about how to use the program

## Compiling

You can compile using Deno (`deno compile --allow-all index.ts`), then use the executable as normal.
