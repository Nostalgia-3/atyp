Realistically, I could probably use this as a frame for basically all command-line
tools. The main reason I'm thinking of that is just because it works surprisingly
well for it being so badly programming (and like 90% of the code was written while
I'm very tired).

There are some pretty obvious things I need to do:
    - Implement more keys (such as INS, DEL, and END)
    - Cleanup the code to decrease repeated code
    - Make rendering not redraw everything every keystroke like it does now
    - Make more commands to allow for programming reasonably well
    - Fix bugs that are currently in the program
    - Add mouse support (e.g. clicking on a character should move the cursor to that
    character)
    - Make more stuff customizable (using the config system)
    - Watch open files (and buffers) for changes, and ask user accordingly
    - Make a system for having multiple open buffers (like with vim)
        - This includes a "terminal" buffer, which connects to something like
        powershell or shell (or something completely different)
    - Implement selecting text
        - This includes selecting with mouse support (though true atyp users don't
        use the mouse ;>)

And here are some goals that I want to achieve:
    - Make the editor good enough to program in itself
        - Do things listed above
    - Make a "DOC" mode, where you can make docs that can be interacted with
    - Make something cool in the editor
    - Put stuff on the internet through something like GitHub
    - Make a ton of stuff modular, including a plugin system
